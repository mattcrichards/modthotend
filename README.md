My New Matter MOD-t hot end failed. Perhaps yours did too... 

Having no experience with 3D printing, I inherited a MOD-t and started my journey. [After getting it all set up](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki/Initial-Setup) I managed a handful of prints with moderate success before having the clog of all clogs which melted through what I assume was a PTFE liner in the proprietary throat of New Matter's proprietary hot end. Despite a thorough search, I could not find PTFE with the interior and exterior diameter that worked with New Matter's throat. New Matter wasn't much help, seeing as it didn't exist anymore, so I was up the creek without a... hot end.

Be that as it may, I was mid-covid lockdown and the printer had become a much needed source of interest and entertainment for me and my kids. As such, I set out to build a replacement hot end to get the printer up and running once again. 

[Over on the wiki](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki) you will find a description of what I used, what I did and what I didn't do to get my MOD-t up and running again. 

Having gotten the printer operational with the new hot end, I continued to have issues unloading filament. I subsequently learned that in response to others reporting the same issue, "near the end" New Matter advised users to stop unloading filament entirely. As such, I have taken to leaving my filament loaded, and when I need to change filament I simply cut the existing filament and use the "Load Filament" function to feed the new roll in, letting it extrude until I see the new color. 

Disclaimer: While this process worked for me, I make no claims as to it's effectiveness, safety or otherwise. Should you choose to follow these steps, you do so at your own risk...
