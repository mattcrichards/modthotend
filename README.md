My New Matter MOD-t hot end failed. Perhaps yours did too... 

Having no experience with 3D printing, I inherited a MOD-t and started my journey. [After getting it all set up](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki/Initial-Setup) I managed a handful of prints with moderate success before having the clog of all clogs which melted through what I assume was a PTFE liner in the proprietary throat of New Matter's proprietary hot end. New Matter wasn't much help, seeing as it didn't exist anymore, so I was up the creek without a... hot end.

Be that as it may, I was mid-covid lockdown and the printer had become a much needed source of interest and entertainment for me and my kids. As such, I set out to build a replacement hot end to get the printer up and running once again. 

I began with research and found this:

1. [I found this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/newmatter/comments/85ezj8/upgrading_the_hotend_on_my_modt/)
2. [And the guide to which it linked](https://imgur.com/gallery/ApFvX)

And I gotta say, this was super helpful if a bit vague. To whomever posted those guides, THANK YOU.

[Over on the wiki](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki) you will find a description of what I did, and what I needed, to get my MOD-t up and running again. 

Disclaimer: While this process worked for me, I make no claims as to it's effectiveness, safety or otherwise. Should you choose to follow these steps, you do so at your own risk...
